# 18.2.2 - Form design & states

> Getting data is the bread-and-butter of the web. This is how our systems communicate with people. Logging in, chattting, sending photos, etc… are all examples of sending data through form.


## Suggested path
1. Find a form on a website you enjoy.
  - I suggest a “log in” form
2. Take screenshots of at least 2 states of the form: Default and error.
  - Default is what the form looks like when you first go to the page
  - Error states are usually shown when submitting invalid info in form fields. You could even trigger it by pressing “submit” with no data.
3. Create a new file inside of your portfolio, let’s call it `forms.html`
4. Use these screenshots as reference to build the HTML first.
  - Focus on the structure (remember top left to bottom right).
5. Now look at the presentation and build the CSS
  - Focus on the larger layout tasks first. Work your way into the smaller details.
6. For the second state, copy and paste the form (so you should have two on the same page).
  - Please try to use “Atomic” css or “Block Element Modifier” patterns for writing your CSS classes.


## Deliverables
1. Please push up your code to your portfolio repo and email a link to this new forms page. `helpmeunderstandcode@gmail.com`.


## Adventuring further
1. Given you’ve completed the suggested path, and submitted you work so far!
2. Research and find a more complex form to build. I suggest either: signup or checkout.
  - Both of these forms should be easy to find! They typically contain a much higher number of input fields.
3. Create a new file inside of your portfolio and call it `forms-adventure.html`
4. Build the HTML and CSS referencing screenshots of these more complex forms in their default state.
5. Now build out the “error” state for the form (copy and paste so you have two on the same page.
  - Remember to use “BEM” or “Atomic” naming.
6. Push up your work and email me a another link to this work!

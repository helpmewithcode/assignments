> Empracing living apps and their designs through mimicking their style to begin to build your own.


## Suggested flow
1. Research Hulu’s design of their homepage
2. Focus in on their design
3. Add a portfolio page
4. Build out the structure
5. Build out presentation
6. Delivery


## 1. Researching Design
![Screenshot of Hulu’s current homepage. Red rectangle for emphasis on what to focus on.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_54BB0A4FC15E6032ADE694545F2B808DD3C3C49040625A8E8CE595A7E1C18034_1526006153534_file.jpeg)


Totally go and check out Hulu’s homepage and even pop open the “inspector” for the web browser of your choice. There’s no problem with looking at how their developers have created this design on the web.

## 2. Focus in on their design

Take note of the “tiling” the images have done here. The measurements (width and height), the title and category text. All of these are parts of what make this design unique and enticing.

I highly recommend taking measurements and placing them inside of your code as comments to begin with! They’ll help you stay focused in the code as you’re researching approaches to re-creating this design inside of your `portfolio` web app.

## 3. Add a portfolio page

Using [the lecture as a guide](https://github.com/helpmewithcode/assignments/blob/master/examples/youtube.html), please add a new folder to your `portfolio` repository called `examples` and then create a file called: `hulu.html` . This is where you’ll place your new HTML code (and link your upcoming stylesheet).

This will act as your blank canvas for creating code examples for many of the assignments moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of time to get familiar, please use this as alignment for expectations of comfort with these technologies. These new topics can be very hard, try your best to focus on: taking notes and communication.  I find it to be less about nailing all of the code parts (html, css, or command line). Those skills will come with time, going through the motions and taking notes are how I believe you can get there with the most “wins.”

## 4. Build out the structure

Using the design from above as reference, start to think about the similarities between each of the “tiles”. Yes they’re different sizes, but focusing on the content itself will help you with the HTML. It’s the separation of the content and presentation that helps aide these web languages to be the best they can, and our alignment with that will help us make the least amount of decsions, but get the best quality output.

Please use [the code I wrote today as reference](https://github.com/helpmewithcode/assignments/blob/master/examples/youtube.html) for how I translated YouTube thumbnails to HTML!

-----

## 5. Build out presentation

Now that you’ve coded up most of the HTML (I’m sure it’ll need tweaks as you move through presentation) you’ll be good to move onto the more visual parts. The CSS will need to be connected to your HTML through a  `<link>` tag inside of the `<head>` of your `hulu.html` file. Once there you can follow similar debugging techniques I showed you today to ensure it is in fact connected!

Now that you have a working HTML/CSS “stack” you should be able to work with adding `class=``""` to each necessary HTML element and then select the class with CSS `.className` selectors. Please use [the code I created this morning as reference](https://github.com/helpmewithcode/assignments/blob/master/assets/css/youtube.css)! At this point the CSS will not be “perfect” or even “good”, I want you to shoot for “it works”. There’s a lot of moving parts of this assignment and this is probably the least important, it’s a moving target!

## 6. Delivery

Please push up all of your changes to Github and then email me a link to this new “hulu” example page. Email at: `helpmeunderstandcode@gmail.com`.

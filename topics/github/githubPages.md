# 18.1.2 - git…hub…pages

> Showing off your work through a history of your work through `git` . Beginning your work on a professional portfolio page.

Keep in mind, this is a huge opportunity to leverage skills you began refining last assignment — taking notes to share your thought-process. These sorts of skills will be essential in not only getting a job but once you have it, as they help you grow and ask meaningful questions.

## **Overviewing steps to complete**

These will be expanded on in their own sections of this!

1. [Create a new repository on Github](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/18.1.2-git-Github-and-Github-Pages-YMMX7X7eLgu2oYZFQgf0c#:uid=538196302212907296810407&h2=Create-a-new-repository-on-Git)
2. [Download Github Desktop](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/18.1.2-git-Github-and-Github-Pages-YMMX7X7eLgu2oYZFQgf0c#:uid=129669429427140408730720&h2=Download-Github-Desktop)
3. [Turn on Github pages in settings](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/18.1.2-git-Github-and-Github-Pages-YMMX7X7eLgu2oYZFQgf0c#:uid=372066151242054840174400&h2=3.-Turn-on-Github-pages-in-set)
4. Adding content to your new portfolio.
5. Deliver a link


----------
## 1. **Create a new repository on Github**
  1. Navigate to GitHub.com and press the “New repository” green button. This button is most likely located on the right side of the page.
  2. Once you tap that button you should see a form much like the one below.

  1. You should only need to fill out one item in the form: “Repository name”. In that field please add the text:  `portfolio`.
  2. GIVEN you’ve filled out the name for the repository THEN the “Create repository” button should light up bright green. Go ahead and tap this.

Now that you’ve created this repository you are good to move onto the next step.


----------
## 2. **Download Github Desktop**
- [You can download the app from here.](https://desktop.github.com)
- Once installed, open the app where you should be prompted to sign into your Github account.
  - Extra meaningful if you use a password management app like: [1Password](https://1password.com). However be cognizant of your time constraint.
- Now you are able to use the menu bar (on Mac it’s located at the top of the screen)
  - Choose: “File” → “Clone repository…”
  - A *modal* should pop up where a list of all repositories you are part of should be listed. Choose

Now that you have the app and repository on your *local* machine you’re good to move on!


----------
## 3. **Turn on Github pages in settings**
> This step (and the next few) will be left **intentionally** ambiguous to create a space to help you refine your online searching skills. Please keep in mind that keeping notes of what you search for will not only help provide more content for a blog (sharing your thoughts/skills with others) but also for your future reflection to learn these skills deeper.


- Search online for tutorials and/or steps to “turn on” Github pages for your repository **

Once Github pages is activated go ahead and move onto the next step!


----------
## **4. Adding content to your new portfolio.**

You’re on a roll! We’re almost to the finish line. This step is to help you bridge the gap between creating content through a text editor (currently Google Docs, Paper by Dropbox, etc) and *deploying* your work to share with the world.


> Please note: This step is totally dependent on you completed the previous assignment. If you don’t have anything to share, feel free to use any appropriate text in its place. If this is your situation, I’d advise adding notes you’ve taken to complete this assignment instead!


- Grab the previous assignments write-up and paste it into the local folder of “/portfolio”. You made use **Finder** on your Mac! You may also use **Terminal** if you feel comfortable doing so.
- You have two possible names to choose from for this file (you can totally do both if you’d like):
    - If it is the previous assignment: `githubAndYou.md`
    - If this is notes for this current assignment: `githubPages.md`
- If you successfully place this file (or both) in the local copy of your `portolio` repository. Then you can now open the **Github Desktop** app and you’ll see something interesting! This is called the *diff.* This is used to show the difference from what *was* in the folder/repository and what is *now* there. Please focus on the area I’ve circled below.
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_DCE28E4988C894F4E9B171F14FEE82B8CD8587AD6ECDDE61576D0A6B8E19C325_1525622519740_Screen+Shot+2018-05-06+at+11.01.47+AM.png)

- This is the *commit message* area of the interface. It’s where we have the power to create a history of changes as we go. I typically look at this as an opportunity to share *why* I am making the changes that I am. You only need to fill out the “Summary” field.
- Once filled out the “Commit to **master**” button should turn bright blue. Feel free to tap that button!
- GIVEN this has been clicked you should now see a button in the top right labelled “Sync”. The is what will initiate the *pull* and *push* process.
  - The approach I’d like you to take helps reinforce the “magic” of the sync button. To find the “push” button navigate again to the top menu bar.
    - Tap: “Repository” → then: “Push”

Once you’ve done this, Github Pages will automatically update your `portfolio` site and you’ll be good to move on.

## **5. Deliver a link**
- Please email: `helpmeunderstandcode@gmail.com` — with a link your new portfolio Github Pages site!

# Adventuring further…
> This is an area for you to venture even further than the assignment/path I’ve laid out. Please finish the assignment first before reading or completing the following. Since the Github pages site will automatically update when you push new changes to your repository, you can email me the link as instructed and update your site **after** you’ve done so, and I’ll se those changes!

Possible stretch goals for your assignment:

- Modify the template (focusing on HTML first) you’re currently using for Github Pages… There is a lot of documentation that should only be one web search away!
- Modify the style and presentation of your site. This will be focusing on the CSS. I highly suggest looking for other peoples portfolio sites to reference for design choices at first. Emulating their style will help you learn how to do the things you like!
  - You could even reference the portfolio’s of the contributors you found from the previous assignment (found from the `react` contributors list).
- Add more blog posts to your portfolio. Maybe you have some ideas you’ve been sitting on to write about. This is a huge adventure you’ve gone on (learning to code) and your perspective is one that I’d love to hear more of. Your new portfolio is a great medium for this.

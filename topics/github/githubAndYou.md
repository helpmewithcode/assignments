# Diving into Github

## What you're jumping into

These are meant to set the stage for the upcoming days and weeks, looping into the skillsets you've identifed as prerequesists for the job you're intesersted in.

Successfully identifying great libraries to use inside of digital products is a key skill. It's an added bonus that this skill is tangential to learning how to use Github! I believe the focus here to be on skimming Github repositories for important information (places where code projects live, also a fancy word for a folder with `git` powers).

## 3 Questions to answer

Please answer each of these questions with 1-5 paragraph responses inside of a Google Document, Paper by Dropbox document, or Github Gist. Once completed I would like you to email this assignment to me at `helpmeunderstandcode@gmail.com` — Good luck!

1. **Search for the** `react` **Github repository and write about your initial thoughts.**

> I would like you to summarize your initial thoughts about the things that jump out at you. Feel free to click around on anything and everything, but the focus here is *initial thoughts* on what you see.

*Prompts to help you write:*

  - Words that jump out at you such as: Pull Requests, Commits, and Facebook
  - Numbers associated with words you found. Lots of these words have "badges" of numbers to the right of them. What do you think they are meant to convey?
  - How many people have contributed to this Github project?
---
2. **Find the contributors for** `react`, **click through their Github profiles, and write your observations.**

> Staying on the Github page for `react` I want you to spend some time searching through a couple of the “Contributors” of this project.

*Prompts to help you write:*

  - Are their profiles “filled out” and/or do they seem active on Github?
  - Do they contribute to other projects?
  - Do these profiles convey experience to you?
  - What types of organizations are they a part of?
---
3. **Sign up for Github yourself and document the experience**

> This is a huge step! If you already have an account, that’s great! Then you can focus on “filling out” your profile to match the current version of yourself.
>
> Keep in mind all of the aspects of contributors to the `react` project (in the previous question). Now I would like you to fill out parts of your profile to be symbolic of *who YOU are* but as a “stepping stone” to becoming someone who shows a level of experience through their Github page.

*Places of your profile I’d like to see completed:*

  - Your bio!
    - This one can be a doozy to finish, but to me, it’s about getting a good version completed and not something that’s perfect!
    - (I promise this will be a skill we work on together everyday, #shipIt).
  - Link to a personal site and/or blog.
  - A profile image of yourself
    - Feel free to put any image you’d like, but keep in mind that these profiles are used for interview processes when companies are looking into hiring you.
    - Probably shouldn’t choose an abstract image, but you totally could, this is my suggestion not prescription.
  - Your `username` is easy to remember or symbolic of you.
    - In my opinion your username is incredibly important (just like your email address). Be aware that these are bits of information that others will use to “get to know you” better, especially through hiring processes.

# Local Jekyll

## Speeding up the dev cycles

Getting a project to run on your local machine if pivotal for speed of development. This major milestone will unlock orders of magnitude in your ability to create digital products.

Getting a new language to run a project (in this case Ruby) is a huge undertaking. There are tools that we’ll later cover to help make this process a bit easier, but for now they will distract from going through the motions of researching, reading errors, documenting your solutions, and (eventually) feeling the great feeling of success!

## Suggested progression

1. Finding and following instructions from Github FAQs
    1. I suggest searching the web for “GitHub pages local machine”
2. Documenting your ideas/thoughts/feelings of going through the steps
3. Saving your documentation to your `portfolio` repo as a new Markdown file
4. Delivering your post
